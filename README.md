# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges. All solutions are written in Python and designed to explore creative and efficient problem-solving techniques. While some solutions might lean on straightforward implementations, others may experiment with advanced methodologies, even when not strictly necessary.

## Repository Structure

Each day's solution is located within the main folder and is named numerically, corresponding to the day. For example:
- The code for Day 1 is in `01.ipynb`.
- The data for Day 1 is in `data/01.txt`.

```
├── 01.ipynb
├── 02.ipynb
├── …
├── data/
│   ├── 01.txt
│   ├── 02.txt
│   ├── …
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advent-of-code-2024.git
```

2.	Navigate to the desired day’s solution and open the Jupyter Notebook.
3.	Run the notebook with its corresponding input data in the Data/ folder.
